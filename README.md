# Concrete Surface Crack Detection

This repository implements a complete pipeline for detecting cracks on concrete surfaces using deep learning.

## Highlights

- Custom CNN model and several pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2)
- Transfer learning with Keras
- Exploratory data analysis and image inspection
- Metrics comparison: Accuracy, ROC AUC, FPR/FNR
- Visualization: ROC curves, confusion matrices, misclassified samples
- Final predictions saved as CSV files
